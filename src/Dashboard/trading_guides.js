                        <h2 id="what-is-p2p-trading">What is P2P Trading?</h2>
                        <p>P2P trading is simply when two people interact directly with each other to buy or sell cryptocurrency. In this form of trading, buyers and sellers sign up to a website (also known as a P2P exchange, P2P marketplace or a P2P platform) and post trade advertisements to buy or sell cryptocurrency at a specific price, or within a certain price range, in a predefined location.<br /><br />The process is very similar to how you would buy or sell items on Etsy, Craigslist or eBay in that the sale is a direct interaction between a buyer and seller at an agreed price, however in this case, the difference is that you are buying or selling cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
                        <p>For example, let's say you want to buy Bitcoin from someone who lives in your city. A P2P exchange lets you find the right person, in the right place, at the right time and make a trade at the right price, using the payment method that works for both of you. It's that simple. </p>
                        <p>People prefer P2P cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://esqro.com/">esqro</a> over centralised exchanges, as they offer faster trades, provide more payment methods and withdrawal options, the best platforms require no KYC or identification verification to become a trader and thus more privacy, and there is no central authority controlling your funds, making it a safe alternative to centralized exchanges.</p>


                        <hr />
                        <h2 id="how-to-make-money-from-p2p-trading">How To Make Money from P2P Trading?</h2>
                        <p>There are various ways in which you can profit from P2P trading platforms and we have compiled this list to help you decide what is the right opportunity for you. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>1) Create Your Own Esqro Crypto Business:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong><a href="https://esqro.com/">esqro</a> </strong>functions as a marketplace where anyone can create their own online business buying and selling cryptocurrency. To set up your business, all you need to do is <a href="https://esqro.com/users/create_offer">create an account</a> and then consider which cryptocurrencies are popular or in high demand and, finally, select which geographical location you will target. The opportunities are endless and are really only limited by how many payment methods you want to offer across the countries that you will service. </p>
                        <p>By becoming your own <a href="https://esqro.com/login/signup">esqro cryptocurrency exchange</a>, and providing a competitive price or alternative payment method, otherwise unavailable in your chosen area, you can set up a profitable business, whilst also providing a service to others around you who may not necessarily have access to cryptocurrency.</p>
                        <p><strong>2) Use Arbitrage To Your Advantage:</strong></p>
                        <p>Arbitrage is simply buying cryptocurrency for a cheaper price in one place and then selling it at a higher price elsewhere. Arbitrage is used by many P2P traders to make money in the cryptocurrency market and it is easy to learn. </p>
                        <p>Arbitrage opportunities occur as price variations between exchanges caused by volatility, liquidity or even due to regional price differences. In some regions of the world, the price difference in a certain cryptocurrency can be so extreme that if you have access to a cheaper price then you can make a profit.</p>
                        <p>Arbitrage trading on P2P exchanges, not only gives people access to cryptocurrency who may not have it, but it is also an easy and practical way to make yourself money on the spread.</p>
                        <p><strong>3) Profit From ‘Payment Methods’ In High Demand:</strong></p>
                        <p>One of the benefits of P2P exchanges, like <strong><a href="https://esqro.com/users/buy_currency">esqro</a></strong>, is that they offer people many more payment and withdrawal options to cash-out to your esqro currency than centralized exchanges. People will often pay a premium price to use a certain payment method that they prefer or is harder to find elsewhere. Cash (fiat) is a great example as it isn’t available on most exchanges.</p>
                        <p>For example, you could buy cryptocurrency with a payment method that is widely accessible, thus the price of the cryptocurrency is far closer to market price, then sell the same cryptocurrency using another payment method that is less accessible allowing you to profit from those willing to pay a premium for convenience. This is best achieved on a P2P exchange like esqro as there are 34 different withdrawal and payment methods to choose from.</p>
                        <p><strong>4) Receive Cryptocurrency As A Passive Income:</strong></p>
                        <p>esqro takes P2P Trading to a whole new level as it’s the only community-owned P2P exchange in the world to give 100% of its profit back to the community. This means that if you also own LCS Cryptoshares, you can not only make money from P2P trading on the esqro P2P exchange, but you can also make a passive income, via dividends, distributed by the esqro team to the comunity on a quarterly basis. If receiving free cryptocurrency as a form of passive income interests you, then you can also buy LCS Cryptoshares on <strong><a href="https://esqro.com/users/buy_currency">esqro</a></strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>5) <strong>Refer </strong>A<strong> Friend To Get A Bonus </strong>Reward<strong>:</strong></strong></p>
                        <p>If you sign up to the esqro P2P exchange within the next month, you will also be one of the first to be notified as soon as the esqro Referral Program goes live. At this stage we are expecting the referral program to go live at the end of February inline with the hard launch of the exchange. The Referral Program gives you the chance to earn money every time a person that you refer to esqro makes a trade. The base referral bonus is 10% for you and 10% for the person that you referred however this bonus percentage increases if you also own LCS Cryptoshares. </p>

                        <h2 id="why-is-p2p-trading-important">Why is P2P Trading Important?</h2>
                        <p>P2P trading is important as it provides more than just an opportunity to make money. It also provides people with access to financial opportunities that are not otherwise possible. </p>
                        <p>It's easy to forget, however many people still don't have access to personal documentation, such as a passport or birth certificate, thus they have no way to complete KYC. For others the financial cost to get a passport that only lasts for 2 - 3 years can be a hurdle too great. Not to mention, 2 billion people are still “unbanked” meaning they have no access to a bank account. These people are finding new ways to trade via their mobile phones using esqro currency innovations. </p>
                        <p>In some areas, centralized exchanges are illegal, inaccessible, unnecessarily complicated or slow and many centralised exchanges have also had major security breaches, where personal data and user funds have been lost or even stolen.</p>
                        <blockquote>“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work…We have to trust them [third parties] with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves [including government] drain our accounts.”<br />– Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote>
                        <p>Within the world of blockchain, many people simply prefer P2P platforms as they don’t believe giant monopolies, such as centralized exchanges, should control the crypto industry making themselves rich off the back of everyday people. Let's face it, Satoshi Nakamoto never envisioned cryptocurrency in its current form and created Bitcoin to avoid centralized third parties, such as banks and centralized exchanges. </p>
                        <p>The reality is that P2P exchanges like <strong><a href="https://esqro.com/login/signup">esqro</a> </strong>put financial power back into the hands of everyday people and many believe that this is the way crypto fundamentally should be.</p>

                        <h2 id="are-there-risks-with-p2p-trading">Are There Risks with P2P Trading?</h2>
                        <p>As you can imagine, when trading any currency there are risks, however, there are fewer risks when trading on a P2P exchange than when trading on a centralized exchange.</p>
                        <p>When you buy cryptocurrency on <a href="https://esqro.com/users/buy_currency"><strong>esqro</strong></a> you are protected by escrow as long as you have proof of payment. </p>
                        <p>When you sell cryptocurrency online, risk often comes in the form of what payment methods you will accept as some payment methods such as Paypal can be charged back after the cryptocurrency trade has taken place. We will provide more information on PayPal trades in the weeks to come. Just as you would on eBay or any e-commerce website, verifying a buyer’s reputation is an important part of staying safe when selling online.</p>
                        <p>We also encourage everyone to be aware of esqro legislation in their respective states and countries, when trading, however this is not only restricted to buying or selling on a P2P exchange but any form of cryptocurrency trading, as laws differ across the globe.</p>
